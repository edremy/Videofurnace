Videofurnace integration module for Moodle.
Author: Eric Remy, edremy@gmail.com
Date: Mar 2011

Thie module searches for tagged files within a Haivision Videofurnace streaming video system and returns a list of all videos tagged
with the course shortname in the AFID field of the Videofurnace metadata for that video

Clicking on a video name generates a launch applet that allows the user to watch the video.

Setup:

0) Tag videos within Videofurnace by opening up the asset in VF editor, and enter a comma-seperated list of course shortnames into
the AFID metadata field
1) Unzip the module into the mods directory, run Site Administration->Notifications
2) Site Administration->Modules->Activities->Videofurnace->Settings
3) Set the server name to the main URL of your Videofurnace server
4) Select if you want conditional access or not.  The setting here *must* match the setting your Videofurnace server.  Setting
conditional access here requires Conditional Access Method in VF to be set to XMLRPC API, otherwise set to NONE.
5) Enter any desired text for copyright warnings
6) Enter the current semester and year.  If these are set, the system will look for a string at the end of every shortname that looks like
_SEMESTERYEAR, ex ENG_201_A_SPRING2011.  Courses that do not match the current semester will not show any videos.  This is designed as a way for 
admins to quickly expire an entire semester's worth of videos.
